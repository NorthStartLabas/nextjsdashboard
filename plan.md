1. Create two pages /outbound/ms/picking and /outbound/cvns/picking
2. Here we will show data from those 4 files that we create (cvns files for /cvns and ms files for /ms)
3. We need a table that will show the user (from QNAME), LINES_PICKED AND ITEMS_PICKED, RATIO EFFORT AND PRODUCTIVITY from daily_stats.
4. And when we click a name we get another table (cascade), that we need to show inside some cards, for each HOUR, the PRODUCTIVITY, LINES PICKED AND ITEMS PICKED, and RATIO.
5. We need above this table, a chart that shows for each HOUR the total of LINES PICKED, using a bar chart, and how many active users where in that hour.
6. We need a button to switch between A-Flow and B-Flow, we show on A-Flow data that has A-flow in the FLOW column and in B-Flow the data that has B-Flow in the FLOW column.

7. Use same styling rules as we have done for the dev page.
